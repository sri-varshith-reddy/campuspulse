      <h2>About the Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Gowtham Sure</strong>, a Computer Science student with a passion for full-stack development and creating experiences that truly resonate with students.
      </p>
      <p>
        I developed CampusPulse using the MVC architecture, integrating a seamless backend and front-end experience to ensure that events and registrations are handled efficiently and stylishly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform is built not just for functionality, but for community — helping students discover, register, and enjoy college events effortlessly.

      <h2>Interface Styling & UX </h2>

    <p>
      The visual design and styling of CampusPulse were led by <strong>Manideep</strong>, who was responsible for implementing the entire front-end styling using custom CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      From layout structure to responsive behavior, color combinations, spacing, and component styling, he translated the platform’s UI goals into actual code — ensuring consistency and usability across all screen sizes.
